							<h5>UTAPS-CDI </h5>
							<p>
								The Utah Transportation and Public Safety – Crash Data Initiative (UTAPS-CDI) is a continuous effort to manage and provide services related to crash data and crash data integration. Our UTAPS-CDI group is supported through a partnership with the Utah Department of Transportation and the Utah Department of Public Safety. Additional details of some features of this project can be found in the summary provided  <a href="utaps.html"> here </a>

							<h5>SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study Pooled Fund: Advancing Implementable Solutions – Phase 2: Calibration of Microscopic Traffic Simulation at Individual Vehicle Level using Naturalistic Driving Behavior</h5>
							<p>
								Typically, the validity of microscopic simulation scenarios is evaluated based on macroscopic measures such as travel time, delay, and queues. This is in part due to limitations or inability to collect field data at a microscopic scale (i.e., for an individual vehicle). This project will leverage microscopic driving behavior and car following metrics directly derived from Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) datasets to develop guidelines to assist and enhance the calibration and verification of microscopic traffic simulation.

							<h5>NCHRP 17-86: Estimating Effectiveness of Safety Treatments in the Absence of crash Data </h5>
							<p>
								Crash modification factors (CMFs) and functions are developed from historic crash data and help safety professionals estimate the expected safety impacts of specific roadway treatments. There has been a significant amount of research to develop CMFs for common safety strategies and many are included in the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (HSM) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) CMF Clearinghouse. However, there are many instances in which developing reliable CMFs with conventional crash-based evaluations may not be practical or possible. The objective of this project is to develop a procedural guide for using alternative measures of safety in the absence of crash data for developing crash modification factors and functions and other quantifiable measures in the absence of crash data.

							<h5>usRAP Safety Assessments in Utah </h5>
							<p>
								Systemic approaches to roadway safety analysis, such as the one provided by usRAP, are gaining momentum in the U.S. The second edition of the Highway Safety Manual will incorporate a chapter on systemic approaches and some of the results for new pedestrian and bicycle analysis are based on iRAP methodologies. An added benefit of these systemic approaches, including usRAP, relies on the “proactive” nature of the analysis because there is no need for crashes to occur in order to flag or identify high-risk locations. The University of Utah collected over 8,000 miles of roadway in Utah part of the Federal-Aid route system. Our team is planning on maintaining states routes, conducting research on calibration, and performing assessments to maximize the use of usRAP for safety improvements.
